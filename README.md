# DATASET
Twitter is one of the most prominent social networking services in the present day. People utilise it to express their ideas and opinions, making it a valuable source of knowledge. Researchers can "Programmatically analyse, learn from, and engage with discourse on Twitter" using the Twitter API. The introduction of social media as a data source has resulted in data collecting via APIs becoming a highly sought-after expertise in many data science positions. Although many social media networks, such as Facebook and Google+, include data that can be studied for sentiment, the majority of academics focused their research on X (previously Twitter) data for sentiment classification since it contains a diverse range of relevant opinionated data.
The data for our dataset was gathered solely from real-world sources. The dataset was constructed using Twitter data. To assess the success of the Indian government, we chose to focus on the Indian budget and government policies because it was trending on Twitter and tweets were readily available. The tweets about the Indian Government Policies and Budget were collected using the Twitter API.
# Steps to collect data
To access data from the Twitter API using Python, follow these instructions.
1. Get Twitter API access: An API key and authentication tokens are required to send any type of request to the Twitter API. To accomplish this, we must first apply for and get approved for a Twitter developer account. Once accepted and approved, a project can be built and linked to a sample application. This app will send the Authentication Token (Bearer Token), which is special and confidential and used for subsequent authentication, as well as the API Key.
2. Retrieve data from Twitter API: Python has numerous methods for retrieving data from the Twitter API. The "tweepy" Python library can be used to connect to and retrieve data from Twitter's API.
3. Authenticating with the credentials: To access to the API, use the given API Key and Authentication Token.
4. Keywords: Set the search parameters and gather Tweets.
5. Generate dataset: Using a pandas dataframe, create a dataset using the properties of tweets retrieved from the Twitter API.
